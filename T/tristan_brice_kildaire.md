Tristan B. Kildaire (Deavmi)
============================

{put a photo of myself here looking downright handsome}

My name is Tristan Brice Kildaire or as I call myself on the Internet in a rather cringy manner _Deavmi_ or _Diskette_.

I have always been interested in technology, more specifically electronic technology, from a young. Anything that had wires basically. As I grew older I realised that my interest was in computers and as I got even older I realised my interest was in getting involved in all of the fun parts of computer science - basically the many facets of it (because all of computer science is interesting to me).

I found my interest in language design and implementation too but this began from an earlier age in a more general want for "my own _thing_". My own _thing_ could be anything really, my own _language_, _protocol_ or _network_. I wanted something that was an expression of my ideals. However, slowly I did start to get more serious about it (the language design) and see it as less of some artistic goal but rather one of practicality with some artistic-flair.

> Also whilst I am writing this may I interject for a moment. ~~It's GNU/Linux~~. Sorry about that. I just wanted to say that damn _ReText_ is such a good editor for Markdown. I feel like I am writing in a journal like in ye old days except it's digital and that's dank.

> I like these interjections; I think I will continue to add them whilst I write this, what I think will be, life long document.

So I got more serious about language design and implementation and then also {continue here}

> I should be studying for French now but that teacher is getting on my nerves.
